This project was made by Carli Nabbe.
It features a prototype for the concept of Tweet Off, an interactive game
where users battle against eachother to guess if a tweet is A.I. generated or not.
This game creates awareness about recognition of A.I. generated content and how it differentiates
from user content. The main goal for this project is to learn people if something is real or fake.

To start this project, open the Index.html in your browser and the game should start.
